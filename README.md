A utility program to keep track of a monopoly game. Note that this is NOT a computer version of Monopoly, this only
keeps track of some elements of a physical game.

## Installation and Use

1. Download the latest stable release from the releases page and extract it to a folder of your choice.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder where you extracted the files (you might need to do so as
   root/admin).
3. Run `MonopolyTracker.pyw`
